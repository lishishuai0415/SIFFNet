## A Semantic Information Feature Fusion Network for Suppressing Diverse DAS-VSP Noise


In SIFFNet, a lightweight self-similar attention module is designed to efficiently extract non-local self-similarity through grid attention.  These  denoising network that leverages both hybrid attention mechanisms and multi-scale processing to recofeatures are fused with learned semantic information of DAS-VSP signals to guide the subsequent dual-branchnstruct local details and global morphology simultaneously. 

## Features


• We propose a semantic information feature fusion network (SIFFNet)  by incorporating semantic information and non-local self-similarity of DAS-VSP data.

• We exploit the non-local self-similarity prior by improved lightweight attention module to effectively and efficiently recover weak seismic signal as well as global structure preservation.

• Guided by semantic and self-similarity, SIFFNet thoroughly suppresses multi-type DAS-VSP noise and recover
